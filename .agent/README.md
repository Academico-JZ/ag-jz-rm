## 🧠 Usage Guide

### 1. Agents (Automatic Routing)

**No need to mention agents explicitly!** The system automatically detects and applies the right specialist(s):

```plaintext
You: "Add JWT authentication"
AI: 🤖 Applying @security-auditor + @backend-specialist...

You: "Fix the dark mode button"
AI: 🤖 Using @frontend-specialist...
```

### 2. Workflows (Slash Commands)

Invoke tactical operations with slash commands:

- **/brainstorm** - Architectural discovery and alternative analysis.
- **/create** - Scaffolding for new startups and complex features.
- **/debug** - Integrated investigation of logic and build failures.
- **/deploy** - Production-ready deployment procedures.
- **/orchestrate** - Massive multi-agent coordination for complex tasks.
- **/plan** - Task-list generation and execution roadmap.
- **/status** - HUD overview of Agent and Repository health.
- **/ui-ux-pro-max** - Design engine with 50 styles and 21 palettes.

### 3. Skills (Contextual Loading)

Skills are loaded automatically based on task context. The AI reads skill descriptions and applies relevant knowledge (e.g., loading `react-patterns` when working on a `.jsx` file).
